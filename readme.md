<h2>ThinkShift</h2>

<h4>A 3rd Year Project</h4>

ThinkShift was a project created by myself and fellow student Niall Dagg ( https://github.com/daggn3/ )

The project is a web app that would allow managers of shift based work to assign shifts to their employees, and their employees wold be able to log in and see their own timetables.

My work is contained in the Backend folder.

The Backend of the project handled:
  - Account creation
  - Account verification
  - Database communication
  - Associating managers with their employees
  - Saving new timetables
  - Displaying the correct timetables to the manager / employee logged in
  - Auto log out after a certain peroid of time
