# Overview

ThinkShift is a web application with the purpose of making it easier and streamlining the process for managers to create shifts and assign timetables for employees. This app was created with small to medium sized businesses in mind. We decided upon this idea from both of our experiences in the retail/service industry and felt this was an area that could be improved. The app is essentially split into two different views, that of the manager and also that of the employee. In this user guide we will describe the functionality for both types of users.

#### 4. Create Timetable


After you have added your employees, you can now click on the calander icon in the navbar, this will navigate you to the timetable page. As no shifts have been created, the timetable will be empty to begin.

Once you are logged in you will be presented with your employee specific timetable. this differs from a manager's timetable as it is view only, so the employee cannot create or edit shifts. They also do not have access to the employee page, and only have the logout button in the navbar.
